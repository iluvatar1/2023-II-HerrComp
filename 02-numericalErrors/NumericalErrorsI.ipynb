    "# Numerical errors (very short intro)\n",
    "Computers are finite. Therefore, they cannot represent the whole range of integer or real numbers. This implies some intrinsic errors when performing numerical computations, errors that one must be aware and control as best as possible. Those errors could appear when you represent a very large (overflow) or very small (underflow) numbers, or when the computer numbers available are different from the one you want to represent (truncation/round-off), or when you perform computations among numbers that are very different, etc. Fortunately, there is a standard that allow us to have the same behavior (and errors) on almost all platforms, the IEEE754 standard. In the following we will explore some of the aspect associated with the integer but specially floating point arithmetic. \n",
